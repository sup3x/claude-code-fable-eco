# claude-eco — eco mode for Claude Code

**Claude Code spends your money on work you never asked for: re-reading files it just edited, pasting back diffs it already applied, writing three-paragraph reports for two-line fixes. I measured every token of it, deleted it, and published all 82 raw runs — including the ones where I lose.**

*Measured hardest on Claude Fable 5 — the hungriest configuration that ever existed — and tuned for every effort-based Claude. `/eco`: −31% to −73% output tokens depending on task and effort level (−63% mean on the flagship n=5 study), with critical findings intact and all produced fixes executed and verified. `/eco-max`: up to −75% by dialing reasoning effort down — opt-in, labeled.*

![Same answer at half the tokens — /eco −31% to −73% depending on task and effort, critical findings intact; /eco-max up to −75%](assets/social-preview.png)

The waste isn't occasional — it repeats on **every turn of every session**, which is why usage limits evaporate and API bills surprise you. **claude-eco** deletes it with two skills:

- **`/eco`** — frugality rules with a non-negotiable quality floor. Full reasoning depth preserved.
- **`/eco-max`** — the same rules plus a **low reasoning-effort override** for routine chores. Effort is the single biggest token lever on modern Claude models (Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8), and of every terse-mode tool we surveyed, this is the only one we found that touches it.

**What that means in practice:** verbose answers shrink 2–4×, replies come back up to 3× faster (30s → 10–15s, measured), and the same weekly limit simply lasts longer — same model, same fixes, minus the padding.

## See the difference

Same question. Same correct answer. Half the tokens — and the critical warning kept. One real pair, shown for illustration and **excluded from the study statistics below** (`what does applyDiscount(100, 'SAVE10') return?`; verbatim, [raw JSONs](benchmarks/raw/)):

**Without eco** (231-token answer):

> `applyDiscount(100, 'SAVE10')` returns **90**.
>
> In `test/orders.js:11-16`, the code looks up `'SAVE10'` in the discounts map and gets `10` (percent), then computes `100 - (100 * 10) / 100 = 90`.

**With /eco** (122-token answer):

> `applyDiscount(100, 'SAVE10')` returns **90** — `SAVE10` maps to 10%, so `100 - (100*10)/100` (test/orders.js:15).
>
> Unrelated bug noticed: `calcTotal` loops `i <= items.length` (test/orders.js:5), so it reads past the array and throws on `items[i].price`.

Half the tokens. That pair is real but hand-picked — eco's answer was chosen precisely because it carried the warning — so instead of implying it's typical, we measured how typical it is: full numbers in [Warning & reporting studies](#warning--reporting-studies) below. One spoiler worth the click: with the buggy file in view (n=5 per arm), eco v1.1 flagged the crash bug **5/5 times; stock Claude, 1/5**. On that surface eco isn't just quieter — it's more reliable.

## Measured results

Baseline = stock Claude Code, `claude-fable-5`, no CLAUDE.md, default system prompt; the eco arm differs only by the skill invocation. **Each row is labeled with its effort level and the skill version that produced it.** The one behavioral change in v1.1 (keep unasked critical warnings) targets tasks where issues are *out of scope*; on the review/fix tasks below, findings are already in scope, so no measurable effect is expected — and the review task was actually re-measured under v1.1 (the n=5 row), with consistent results. The surface v1.1 *does* change was measured separately (warning-rate study, next section).

| Task (effort · skill) | Baseline | With /eco | Output tokens | Cost | Quality |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Code review (max · v1.0) | 1,096 tok | 531 tok | **−52%** | −21% | Single run: both arms found all 3 issues (2 planted + 1 unplanted). At default effort the picture differs — see the n=5 row |
| Real editing (max · v1.0) | 3,776 tok | 1,026 tok | **−73%** | −46% | Fixes verified functionally identical with Node |
| Real editing, re-run (default effort · v1.1 · n=1) | 1,610 tok | 1,107 tok | **−31%** | ≈0% | Both fixes executed and verified identical with Node — v1.1 consistent on in-scope tasks; smaller margin because the default-effort baseline is already leaner |
| Multi-file project, 3-turn session (max · v1.0) | 11,912 tok | 3,285 tok | **−72%** | −46% | Same root cause, same fix, tests pass |
| Code review with /eco-max (max · v1.0) | 1,096 tok | 279 tok | **−75%** | −30% | 2/2 planted bugs; missed the 1 unplanted edge case — that's the effort tradeoff, and it's why eco-max is opt-in |
| **Code review, n=5 per arm (default effort · v1.1)** | 891 mean (824–937) | 328 mean (310–380) | **−63%** (ratio of means) | −12% mean | 10/10 runs found both planted bugs. The unplanted *non-critical* nitpick: baseline 5/5, eco 0/5 — by design; correctness-critical findings are exempt (measured below) |

Note the n=5 row uses a different effort level than the single-run rows, so its baseline (891) is not comparable to theirs (1,096) — that's an effort difference, not variance.

### Warning & reporting studies

Does frugality suppress useful warnings? Measured three ways (n=5 per arm each; details and raw files in [benchmarks/results.md](benchmarks/results.md)):

- **Warning rate** — question never asks for review: the out-of-scope crash bug got volunteered in **1/5 baseline** and **0/5 eco** runs. Neither arm reliably notices what it wasn't asked to look for; the demo pair above is excluded from these statistics.
- **Reporting rate, four arms** — whole file in view: eco **v1.1: 5/5** one-line warnings · **eco-max v1.1 (low effort): 5/5** · reconstructed **v1.0: 0/5** (a defect we suspected, then measured) · no-skill baseline: **1/5**. That isolates the v1.1 quality-floor clause as the cause — and shows it holds even at the lowest effort setting.
- **Detection when asked** — the review task: **10/10** planted bugs found by both arms.

Suppress noise, never *noticed* warnings — and when you want issues found, ask for a review.

Don't take the table's word for it — run the same A/B on **your** task: `./benchmarks/run.sh "your task here"`. Full methodology, grading criteria, a run inventory and 82 raw JSONs: [benchmarks/results.md](benchmarks/results.md). The multi-turn row is the scale test: a 12-file codebase, one invocation in turn 1, and the mode held for the whole session while input-side reads dropped ~40%.

**Reproducibility note:** the Sonnet 5 (Free/Pro default model), Opus 4.8 and Haiku rows are reproducible on any current plan. Fable 5 rows require Fable access — per Anthropic's in-app notice as of July 2, 2026, included in paid plans until July 7 and moving to API usage credits afterwards (check current terms). No Fable? Start from the Sonnet 5 results.

## Install

**Plugin (cleanest):**

```
/plugin marketplace add sup3x/claude-code-eco
/plugin install claude-eco@claude-eco
```

**Personal skill (all your projects):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sup3x/claude-code-eco && cd claude-code-eco && ./install.sh          # macOS / Linux
```
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sup3x/claude-code-eco; cd claude-code-eco; .\install.ps1             # Windows
```

**Project-only:** copy `skills/` into your repo's `.claude/skills/`. This is also what makes `/eco` available in Claude Code **web/mobile cloud sessions** — those only load skills from the repo, not from `~/.claude/skills/`.

**Uninstall:** delete the `eco/` and `eco-max/` folders from your skills directory. `/eco setup` only ever writes plain `settings.json` keys (`effortLevel` and two `env` entries) — remove them to fully revert.

## Usage

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/eco` | Frugal mode for the rest of the session |
| `/eco <task>` | Do the task frugally (mode stays on) |
| `/eco-max <task>` | Maximum savings: frugality rules **plus** low reasoning effort — for routine chores |
| `/eco setup` | Propose permanent savings in `settings.json` — applies only after you confirm |

Works in **any language** — the rules are English, the replies follow yours. No slash commands available (mobile app, web)? Just say it in plain words — "activate eco mode" triggers the skill (verified in English and Turkish). **Invoke once per session, not per question:** activation costs one turn plus ~1.2k input tokens once per session (skill body + descriptions, then cached), so for a single trivial question the overhead exceeds the savings (we measured that too). Activated early, every subsequent answer is ~2–4× smaller. One more honest caveat: if a very long session gets context-compacted, the rules may be summarized away — re-invoke `/eco` after compaction.

Both skills share the v1.1 quality floor, including the keep-noticed-critical-warnings clause — measured on both (5/5 each, eco-max at low effort). Use `/eco` as the everyday default — full reasoning depth on what you ask for. What it stops doing is volunteering *non-critical* extras: in the max-effort single run it matched the baseline's bonus finding, but the default-effort n=5 study shows the honest steady state (baseline volunteers an unplanted nitpick 5/5, eco 0/5) — while correctness-critical warnings stay protected by the quality floor. Use `/eco-max` for renames, small fixes, boilerplate and lookups; it's instructed to tell you and recommend `/eco` if the task turns out hard. Note that its effort override applies per-invocation and effort is part of the prompt-cache key — so calling `/eco-max` mid-way through a long, heavily-cached session can cost a cache rebuild. Best at session start or in short sessions.

## Across models

Same review task; n=1 per cell and v1.0 skill except where labeled. Fable 5 ran at max effort (its session default at the time), the others at their own defaults — so percentages are not directly comparable across rows, and absolute token counts never are (tokenizers differ between models; Sonnet 5 ships an updated one). Only the within-row % matters:

| Model | Baseline | /eco | Output tokens |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Fable 5 (max effort) | 1,096 | 531 | **−52%** |
| Opus 4.8 | 648 | 340 | **−48%** |
| **Sonnet 5 (baseline n=5, eco n=10 · default · v1.1)** | 592 mean (464–770) | 276 mean (204–380) | **−53% mean** |
| Haiku 4.5 | 631 | 733 | **+16% — skip it** |

The Haiku row is a negative result, published on purpose: Haiku is already terse and cheap, so the skill's body overhead isn't worth it there. Biggest wins are at high effort, but default effort works too (−51% to −63% measured). Sonnet 5 got the deep treatment after it became the **Free/Pro default model** — and it produced our most interesting quality finding. The critical crash bug: found in every run by both arms (baseline 5/5, eco 10/10). The secondary NaN edge case: baseline 5/5, **eco 6/10** — a tendency that persisted when we extended eco from n=5 to n=10, though with baseline still at n=5 it is not yet statistically conclusive. The consistent pattern suggests brevity pressure on Sonnet sometimes trims the minor finding. If your review workflow depends on exhaustive minor-issue sweeps on Sonnet, that's a real cost; a completeness-over-brevity clause for review tasks is the candidate fix for v1.2 and will be benchmarked before it ships. The single-run rows found every planted bug in both arms.

## What it actually does

1. **Replies** — lead with the answer; no preamble, recap, or unprompted progress summaries; soft ≤8-line default; never paste back files just written (cite `path:line`); one solution, not a menu.
2. **Reasoning** — deliberate minimally on routine steps, think deeply only at genuine decision points.
3. **Tools** — Edit over Write (Write re-emits whole files); grep first, then read only the matched region; no re-reads after own edits; batch independent calls; quiet shell flags; broad sweeps via one cheap Haiku subagent.
4. **Quality floor** — read before changing, verify when the task calls for it, never truncate deliverables, and report noticed correctness-critical findings in one line even when unasked (v1.1). If brevity ever conflicts with correctness, correctness wins.

### Why no hard word cap?

Anthropic shipped a hard "≤100 words" cap in the Claude Code system prompt on 2026-04-16 and **reverted it four days later** after measuring a 3% coding-quality drop ([postmortem](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/april-23-postmortem)). claude-eco uses behavioral rules with a soft, escapable length default — the savings come from deleting waste, not from squeezing substance.

## Squeeze further

The biggest lever on effort-based Claude models (Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8) is the **reasoning effort level**: on Opus 4.5, [Anthropic measured](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) medium effort matching a peer model's quality with 76% fewer output tokens. `/eco setup` proposes `"effortLevel": "medium"` persistently; `/eco-max` applies a per-task override. Pick effort at session start — mid-session switches invalidate the prompt cache. The full ranked list (cache hygiene, MCP schema debloat, subagent economics, CLAUDE.md diet) is in [docs/token-optimization-guide.md](docs/token-optimization-guide.md).

## FAQ

**Why are your percentages bigger than other rulesets report?** Regime. On one-shot Q&A prompts there's little fat to cut — drona23's own raw data honestly shows ~2–11%. On *agentic coding tasks* — where an unconstrained model pastes diffs, writes long reports, and creates unrequested files — there is far more waste; that's what we measured, with quality graded and fixes executed. Run the harness on your workload and trust your own number.

**What does this do to my actual bill?** Output tokens are only part of a Claude Code bill — input/context often dominates. That's why we report cost, not just tokens: **≈0% to −46%** measured total cost per task. The low end is the single-pair fix re-run at default effort — the baseline there is already lean, and one-shot costs are dominated by fixed session overhead. The high end comes from long agentic tasks at high effort, where eco also cuts the input side (~40% fewer read-tokens in the multi-turn test via grep-first reading) and fewer turns mean fewer full-context passes. Your split depends on cache configuration; the raw JSONs itemize both sides.

**Does it make Claude dumber?** `/eco` — mostly no; it makes Claude quieter, and we publish the exceptions. In the v1.0 max-effort benchmarks it found every planted bug and produced functionally identical, test-passing fixes; the v1.1 n=5 study confirms 10/10 planted-bug consistency at default effort on Fable. On Sonnet 5 it matched the critical crash bug 10/10 but missed a secondary edge-case bug in 4/10 runs — reported in the models section. One real tradeoff we noticed and addressed: early versions also suppressed *useful* unsolicited observations, so the v1.1 quality floor explicitly requires correctness-critical findings to be flagged in one line even when unasked — suppress noise, never warnings. Honest scope note: that's a guarantee about *reporting* what gets noticed, not about noticing — the warning-rate study in [benchmarks/results.md](benchmarks/results.md) shows out-of-scope issues rarely get noticed by either arm on tasks that don't ask for review. `/eco-max` *does* lower reasoning effort — opt-in, per task, labeled.

**Why was it built around Fable 5?** Because that was the hungriest configuration in existence: the headline single-run benchmarks (v1.0) ran on `claude-fable-5` at **max** effort — the worst case, not a cherry-picked easy one. The v1.1 studies add the default-effort picture and the Sonnet 5 deep study, where savings are smaller but consistent.

**Other models?** Measured with `/eco`: −48% on Opus 4.8, −53% mean on Sonnet 5 (eco n=10 — now the Free/Pro default model), −31% to −73% on Fable 5 depending on task and effort (the −75% figure is `/eco-max`, which lowers effort). The exception is Haiku (+16%, skip it) — see [Across models](#across-models).

**How much do the skills themselves cost?** ~1.2k input tokens once per session when invoked (skill body plus the two ~60-token descriptions loaded at startup), cached afterwards. Same number as in Usage above — it's why activating for one trivial question isn't worth it.

**Can a skill reduce thinking tokens?** Softly at best via instructions — on adaptive-reasoning models like Fable 5, thinking follows the effort setting and `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is ignored ([model config docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config)). That's exactly why `/eco-max` overrides effort via skill frontmatter and `setup` proposes a persistent `effortLevel`.

**What can't it fix?** The fixed session overhead (system prompt, tool schemas), MCP schema bloat, and your CLAUDE.md size — the [guide](docs/token-optimization-guide.md) covers those levers.
