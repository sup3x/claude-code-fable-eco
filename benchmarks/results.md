# Benchmark Results

All runs: 2026-07-02, Claude Code on Windows 11, model `claude-fable-5`, session default effort **max** (the worst case this project targets), headless `claude -p --output-format json`. Primary metric is `usage.output_tokens` (deterministic per run — thinking + text + tool-call payloads). Raw JSON for every run is in [`raw/`](raw/).

## Task 1 — Read & review (`explain what test/orders.js does, identify bugs`)

The fixture has 2 planted bugs (off-by-one crash at line 5, division-by-zero at line 20) plus 1 unplanted exotic issue (prototype-chain lookup in `applyDiscount`) that a max-effort review can find.

| Arm | Output tokens | Δ | Cost | Time | Issues found (2 planted + 1 unplanted possible) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| No skill, effort max | 1,096 | — | $0.264 | 30s | 3/3 |
| Skill v1, effort max | 403 | −63% | $0.204 | 15s | 2/2 planted, missed unplanted |
| **Skill v2, effort max** | **531** | **−52%** | $0.208 | 17s | **3/3 — full parity** |
| Effort probe (`effort: low` frontmatter only, no rules) | 505 | −54% | $0.240 | 22s | 2/2 planted + partial 3rd |
| Skill v1 + `--effort medium` (CLI flag) | 297 | −73% | $0.253 | 10s | 2/2 planted, missed unplanted |
| **Eco variant (rules + `effort: low`)** | **279** | **−75%** | $0.185 | 16s | 2/2 planted, missed unplanted |

**Grading criteria** (fixed before the runs): an arm scores a planted bug if it identifies the faulty line AND the failure mode (crash / NaN); the unplanted third issue (prototype-chain lookup in `applyDiscount`) is graded as bonus depth, not a pass/fail item, since it was not deliberately planted. Fix-task arms are graded by executing the fixed module with Node against fixed inputs — pass requires identical, correct behavior. Where an arm missed the unplanted issue the table says so explicitly.

Notable: the `effort:` frontmatter probe proves the override works on inline skill invocation — 54% fewer output tokens with **zero** behavioral instructions.

## Task 2 — Real editing (`fix the bugs in orders.js`, acceptEdits)

Functional equivalence of both fixed files was verified with Node.js after the runs: identical results (`calcTotal=11`, `averageItemPrice([])=0`, formatting correct).

| Arm | Output tokens | Δ | Cost | Time | Turns | Outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| No skill | 3,776 | — | $0.712 | 88s | 10 | Both bugs fixed; also created an **unrequested** smoke-test file and wrote a long report |
| **Skill v2** | **1,026** | **−73%** | **$0.384 (−46%)** | 35s | 5 | Both bugs fixed; brief honest report |

## Task 3 — Trivial question (`what does applyDiscount(100,'SAVE10') return?`)

| Arm | Total output tokens | Final answer alone | Cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| No skill | 340 | 220 | $0.172 |
| Skill invoked *for this one question* | 398 | **79** | $0.261 |

**Honest finding:** invoking the skill costs one extra turn plus the skill body (~1.3k input tokens cached). For a single micro-question that overhead exceeds the savings — but once the mode is active, each answer is ~3× smaller (79 vs 220). **Invoke once per session, not per question.** Both arms answered correctly (90); the no-skill arm also volunteered an unrelated bug report.

## Task 4 — Multi-file project, persistent 3-turn session (scale test)

Fixture: `tasks/bigproject/` — a 12-file in-memory e-commerce service (routes/models/services/utils layers) with one planted cross-file bug: `utils/money.js round()` returns a `toFixed(2)` **string**, so `services/pricing.js totalFor()` concatenates instead of adding (`"13.501.35"`). Three chained turns in ONE session per arm (via `--resume`): (1) architecture overview, (2) diagnose the broken totals from a customer symptom, (3) fix so the test passes. Skill invoked **once**, in turn 1. Skill version: v2.1 (adds grep-first targeted reading and no-unprompted-recap rules).

| Turn | Baseline out-tokens | Skill out-tokens | Baseline cost | Skill cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 — overview | 2,372 | 1,151 | $0.553 | $0.342 |
| 2 — diagnose | 2,941 | 636 | $0.765 | $0.394 |
| 3 — fix | 6,599 | 1,498 | $0.804 | $0.407 |
| **Session total** | **11,912** | **3,285 (−72%)** | **$2.12** | **$1.14 (−46%)** |

- **Quality: parity.** Both arms found the exact root cause (`money.js:9` → string concat in `pricing.js`), both produced a correct 2-line fix preserving `formatUSD`'s two-decimal display, and both fixed files pass `tests/pricing.test.js` (executed independently with Node after the runs).
- **Persistence: confirmed.** The skill was invoked only in turn 1; turns 2–3 stayed frugal without re-invocation (same `session_id` across all three results).
- The largest gap was the fix turn (−77%): the baseline pasted before/after code blocks of the diff it had already applied and wrote a report three times longer; in turn 2 it also attempted five blocked shell commands and drafted a repro script nobody asked for.
- Input side moved the same direction: ~649k cumulative cache-read tokens (baseline) vs ~390k (skill) — fewer, more targeted reads.
- Honest nuance: the unrestricted baseline volunteered extra observations (an unenforced config constant, a float-vs-cents design critique) — genuinely interesting, unasked, and each billed. That is precisely the dial this skill turns.

## Task 6 — Variance study, n=5 per arm (same review task as Task 1)

Run after the v1.1 skill update (adds the "flag correctness-critical findings even unasked" rule — inert on this task, where bugs are explicitly requested). Five sequential runs per arm at the default effort level, no parallel cache races.

| Arm | Runs (output tokens) | Mean | Range | Planted bugs | Unplanted bonus issue |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Baseline | 937, 824, 894, 933, 866 | **891** | 824–937 | 5/5 both found | 5/5 found |
| /eco | 316, 310, 380, 314, 318 | **328** | 310–380 | 5/5 both found | 0/5 found |

**Savings: −63% mean, worst-case pairing −54%, best −67%.** Consistency is the point: every single run of both arms found both planted bugs; the spread within each arm (±6% baseline, ±11% eco) is far smaller than the gap between arms. The honest nuance: at this effort level the baseline reliably volunteers the unplanted edge case and eco reliably doesn't — volunteered depth is what the token savings buy. When such an observation is correctness-critical, the v1.1 quality floor requires eco to flag it in one line (verified on the trivial-question task, `raw/triv2.json`).

## Task 5 — Cross-model check (same review task as Task 1)

| Model | Arm | Output tokens | Δ | Cost | Planted bugs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Opus 4.8 | baseline | 648 | — | $0.112 | 2/2 |
| Opus 4.8 | /eco | 340 | **−48%** | $0.100 | 2/2 |
| Sonnet 5 | baseline | 543 | — | $0.094 | 2/2 |
| Sonnet 5 | /eco | 262 | **−52%** | $0.067 | 2/2 |
| Haiku 4.5 | baseline | 631 | — | $0.024 | 2/2 |
| Haiku 4.5 | /eco | 733 | **+16%** | $0.026 | 2/2 |

The Haiku row is a **negative result and we're keeping it**: Haiku's baseline is already terse, so eco's skill-body overhead outweighs the savings (its eco arm also padded the answer with a debatable third "bug"). Recommendation: use `/eco` on high-effort frontier models; skip it on Haiku. All arms found both planted bugs.

## Methodology & caveats

- **Most cells are n = 1** (single-shot runs; treat percentages as effect sizes, not lab constants) — except the flagship review task, which has a dedicated n=5-per-arm variance study (Task 6). The direction and rough magnitude were consistent across all 35 runs (Haiku being the honest exception, documented above).
- Several arms ran **in parallel**, which races prompt-cache population between processes — `total_cost_usd` is therefore noisier than `output_tokens` (which is unaffected). The [run scripts](run.ps1) execute arms sequentially for cleaner cost numbers.
- One-shot sessions carry a fixed overhead (~45–50k cached input tokens: system prompt, tools, skill descriptions) that dominates single-run cost. In real multi-turn sessions the per-turn output savings compound while the fixed overhead amortizes — the percentages above are conservative for long sessions.
- Auto-memory was disabled during all v2 runs (headless mode loads project memory by default, which would have contaminated both arms).
- Bug-finding quality was graded against the 2 planted bugs; the exotic third issue is a max-effort bonus, and losing it at low effort is the documented eco-max tradeoff.
- Naming: all runs predate the `token-saver` → `claude-eco` rename, so raw JSONs show `/token-saver` (now `/eco`) and `/token-saver-eco` (now `/eco-max`) invocations. Rule content is identical; only titles and self-references changed, and post-rename loading was re-verified.
